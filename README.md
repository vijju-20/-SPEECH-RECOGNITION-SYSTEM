#Internship-Task 2
#BUILD A BASIC SPEECH-TO-TEXT SYSTEM USING PRE-TRAINED MODELS AND LIBRARIES LIKE SPEECHRECOGNITION OR WAV2VEC.
#DELIVERABLE: A FUNCTIONAL SYSTEM CAPABLE OF TRANSCRIBING SHORT AUDIO CLIP
#The speech_recognition library in Python is a tool that simplifies integrating speech recognition into our applications
#It acts as a wrapper for various speech-to-text APIs and engines, allowing us to convert spoken language into text
#import the library speech_recognition for use in our program
#The Recognizer class is a fundamental component of the SpeechRecognition library in Python
#It processes audio input and performs speech recognition tasks 
#Initializes the recognizer class
#For testing this recognizer class, i have recorded an audio and saved it as a .WAV file
#Provide the complete file path of the audio file
#The recognizer.record() function is used to record audio from a microphone
#or audio source and store it as an AudioData object, which can then be used for speech recognition
#Read from the audio file and store the data in audio_data object
#The recognize_google() method on it to access the Google web speech API and turn spoken language into text. 
#The recognize_google() requires an argument audio_data otherwise it will return an error.
#Recognize the speech
#Capture the error and print the error message
